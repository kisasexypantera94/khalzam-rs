## About
`khalzam` is an audio recognition library that makes it easy to index and recognize audio files.
It focuses on speed, efficiency and simplicity.
Its algrorithm is based on [this article](https://royvanrijn.com/blog/2010/06/creating-shazam-in-java/).

## TODO
* Rethink the way hashes are stored â€“ use inverted index
* Try to solve less specific problems:
  * query by humming
  * animal sounds recognition

## Setup
You need to create and initialize database:
```zsh
$ sh ./setup.sh
```

## Usage
You can use the library either
through the [API](https://github.com/kisasexypantera94/khalzam-rs/tree/master/examples)
or using [khalzam-cli](https://github.com/kisasexypantera94/khalzam-cli)
